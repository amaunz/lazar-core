============
Installation
============

These are build instructions for Ubuntu, a Debian-based Linux distribution, release 7.04 (Feisty Fawn). For other distributions the process should differ only slightly.


Preliminaries 
=============

bin-libs
---------
GNU Scientific Library (GSL) (issue as root):
box:~$ aptitude install libgsl0-dev libgfortran1-dev build-essential


Compilation
===========

svn checkout svn://www.in-silico.de/lazar/trunk (obviously you have already done this)
cd trunk/ && make

After successful compilation, you should have created (among others) the executable lazar in the current directory.
